# Contributing to dasae-headers

Thank you for your interest in contributing to dasae-headers! This guide will help you get started with the contribution process.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the project:

- **Code Contributions** - Implement new features or fix bugs
- **Documentation** - Improve or expand the documentation
- **Examples** - Create example code demonstrating usage
- **Testing** - Write tests to improve coverage
- **Bug Reports** - Report issues you encounter
- **Feature Requests** - Suggest new features or improvements

## Getting Started

### Development Environment Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dasae-headers.git
   cd dasae-headers
   ```

3. Set up the upstream remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/coding-pelican/dasae-headers.git
   ```

4. Create a new branch for your work:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```

### Building the Project

<!-- TODO: Add building instructions -->

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

All code contributions should follow the DH-C Standard Coding Convention:

- Use PascalCase for type names
- Use snake_case for variables and parameters
- Use camelCase starting with a verb for function names
- Indentation is 4 spaces
- Include clear comments for complex logic
- Add documentation comments for public APIs

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Fix bug" not "Fixes bug")
- First line should be 50 characters or less
- Reference issues if applicable

Example:

```txt
feat: Add `ArrList_sortBy` function for custom sorting

This adds a new function to the `ArrList` module that allows sorting
with a custom comparator function. The implementation uses quicksort
for performance.

Fixes #42
```

### Pull Requests

1. Update your feature branch with the latest upstream changes:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. Make sure your code passes all tests
3. Push your branch to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```

4. Create a pull request on GitHub
5. Describe what your changes do and why they should be included

### Documentation Contributions

When contributing to documentation:

1. Follow the existing structure and formatting
2. Include all required metadata in the front matter
3. Update any related documentation that might be affected
4. Use consistent terminology throughout

## Testing

All new features should include appropriate tests:

- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for feature interactions
- Performance tests for performance-sensitive code
